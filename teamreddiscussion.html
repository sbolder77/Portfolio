										<h2 id="content">What is a Secure Programming Language?</h2>
										<p>We were asked to answer a series of questions related to Python and secure programming languages and then share with the team for discussion.</p>
										<br>
										<h3 id="content">Question 1</h3>
										<p>What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</p>
										<p>There are several factors to consider to determine the secure nature of a programming language as well as taking into account known vulnerabilities. Cifuentes & Bierman (2019) discuss the three categories of vulnerability - buffers, injections and information leak. In addition to this considerations must be made to the number of vulnerabilities in the CWE (Common Weakness Enumneration) list. One must also consider the robustness and resiliency of a programming language. In addition considerations should be made to the libraries a programming language can or cannot use to secure methods such as authentication, encryption and it's interaction with and transaction of data.</p>
										<h3 id="content">Question 2</h3>
										<p>Could Python be classed as a secure language?</p>
										<p>As with many programming languages a number of fators should be taken into consideration. Python as a language does have the ability and libraries to perform secure coding practices but it is very dependent on the quality of code and the skill and experience of the developer. If a developer is inexperienced then regardless of what you program software to do then carelessness will introduce vulnerabilities. Similarly to using open source libraries without care and consideration to the authors and contributors to those libraries. Similarly an experienced developer would use experience and knowledge to write logical and well structured code. khoirim (2020. Discuss may uses, advantages and disadvantages of Python. Whilst the points on advantages and disadvantages do not clearly call out if Python is a suitable langauge for secure programming the points raised do indicate it has limitations. However dependent on the use of Python for specific tasks would point to Python having enough secure abilities then an assessment could be made at the point of design or analysis to use Python for tactile development of a specific solution and teh use of it's libraries as well as the abilities of the developers to make it secure.</p>
										<h3 id="content">Question 3</h3>
										<p>Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C?</p>
										<p>Given the points discussed and limited knowledge on C my initial thoughts would be that Python would not be a suitable or more appropriate language to create operating systems. Whilst Python has many advantages in regards to simplicity it has disadvantages. Khoirim 2020 highlight facts including the simplicity of the language, it's limitation to 'one thread at a time' and limitations in database access as well as it's limitations on memory comprehensive work. Considering Python as more of an interpreted language suitable to the application layer it perhaps would not be suitable for high performance, multi threaded and memory intensive computing tasks.</p>
