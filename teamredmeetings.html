									<h2 id="content">Team Meetings</h2>
										<p>The team were asked to not only setup regualr meetings but also to record and document the meetings. Below is a summary of the meetings we had to show progress and how were progressing as a team, discussing and resolving issues, assigning tasks and illustrates the progress we made. In addition to the collaborative tools we also used whatsapp as a more informal means of asking questions either 1:1 or as a group so we could continue working outside of the scheduled meetings. Microsoft Teams was also used to run our teams meetings so we could present documents and also review and execute code realtime so the team could understand progress and what had been done.</p>

									<h2>Collaboration Tool - Miro</h2> 
										<h3 id="content">Thinking</h3>
											<p>The team agreed to use a tool called Miro for the purposes of tracking ideas, design thoughts, high level requirements and general ideas. We used this as a base to elicit functional and non-functional requirements which were then recorded in a seperate tool. It also allowed us to work together in real time without the need for meetings while giving us a platform to review efforts on a regular basis.</p>

									<h2>Collaboration Tool - Trello</h2> 
										<h3 id="content">Acting</h3>
											<p>The team agreed to use Trellio which is an Atlassian product which gave us the use of a board similar to a Jira scrum or agile board. This allowed us to capture detailed requirements and tasks for individuals. This would support the develoment process by the team been able to progress development through in progress to done in a typical sprint fashion.</p>
