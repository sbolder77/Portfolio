										<p>Regarding Appendix A of the Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate (DiBona & Ockman, 1999) and research conducted by Fritzch et al. (2019) I would agree that Microservices and Microkernels are the future. However, there are many design and architectural considerations to be made when discussing Monolithic v Microservice or Microkernel.
										<br>
										<br>
										There do appear to be significant benefits of microservices and microkernels over monolithic kernels. Monolithic kernel architecture is dependent on tightly coupled programming. As they grow and develop these monolithic architectures can become complex introducing significant technical debt and making the product unmaintainable. The Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate from 1992 took place when 386 chips were dominant and as such the limits of technology are a factor in this discussion due to the nature of the 386 chipsets. The limited size of this chipset and early computing could be considered a contributing factor to the development of monolithic kernels and architecture. Furthermore, a monolithic application is a single application and therefore presents a single attack surface. Isaac et al. (2021) discuss the risks of monolithic architecture and how it leads to reliability and security issues and how a potential bug could lead to a buffer overrun causing a system to crash. In addition to the maintenance and complexity, these features of monolithic kernels have driven and promoted the move to microservices and microkernels.
										<br>
										<br>
										Microkernels in contrast do offer advantages over Monolithic kernels. Isaac et al. (2021) in their review focussed on three significant features of microkernels including interprocess communication, process scheduling and memory management from the original L4 kernel to seL4, Muen separation Kernel and NOVA Micro-Hypervisor. The research clearly shows the further evolution of the microkernel architecture. Considering these 3 features the benefits of a microkernel architecture can be realised. Process scheduling can be driven by priority and schedulers can choose higher priority context from a run queue and introduce threading. Furthermore, the inclusion of Physical Memory Allocators (PMA) which are created for each CPU core offers further scalability and performance.
										<br>
										<br>
										With the introduction of cloud computing the concept of Microservices is also becoming more relevant. As with microkernels, microservices also seek to further decompose and decouple monolithic processes to provide more scalability. Additionally, the cloud and modern technologies and platforms provide high availability, and redundancy and are compliant with modern security standards. Fritzch et al. (2019) discuss how microservices address the inherent issues with monolithic applications. Identifying and encapsulating related modules into services drives loose coupling of application functionality. As with monolithic kernels, monolithic applications suffer from the same levels of complexity and can become unmaintainable.
										<br>
										<br>
										However, there are challenges with microservice and microkernel architectures. One of the key challenges is the decomposition of the monolithic architecture and the strategies used. The decomposition strategies proposed by Fritzch et al. (2019) offer context and insight into static code analysis and meta-data aided. Furthermore, workload data and dynamic service composition are all strategies that should be followed when considering refactoring a monolithic architecture into a 'micro' architecture. The investment required to build a new microservices or microkernel architecture can be very expensive as well. Refactoring an existing monolithic architecture can be just as expensive. The benefits of a 'micro' architecture including the research and results have discovered that microservices and microkernels are the future.</p>
