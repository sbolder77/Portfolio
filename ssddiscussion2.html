										<p>The assumption that TrueCrypt is not secure is well supported and proven by Junestam and Guigo (2014) in their cryptanalysis report. The 11 identified vulnerabilities are components of any secure piece of software. Whilst the report does not identify high severity risks the 4 medium risks identified include cryptography, data exposure and validation which can all be considered significant. In regards to cryptography and the key encryption the limitation of TrueCrypt's functions in hashing credentials exposes the software to brute force attacks. The solutions offered to this include configuration to support advances in GPU and CPU but this still does not resolve the restrictive nature of the function. Furthermore, by adding additional key derivation functions in a longer term solution would require the software to be maintained but would also require investment in hardware resources. Additionally, the medium data risks in TrueCrypt have limitations on their functions to handle inputs, arrays and arguments for data validation as well as exposing data to be surfaced to non-encrypted volumes. These risks alone combined with the support and maintainability for TrueCrypt and much of it's redundant and deprecated technology does make it an insecure piece of software in the modern computer science domain.
										<br>
										<br>
										In relation to the question of would i recommend TrueCrypt as a secure storage environment to a friend or potentially an organisation, I would refer to the points written above. The findings by Junestam and Guigo (2014) offer many recommendations in regards to code quality, deprecated functions, inconsistent variable types as well as weaknesses in integrity checks and ciphers. In addition to the lack of maintainability the recommendations by the authors also point to outdated build tools and packages that are hard to source from trustworthy providers. As well as significant investment in source code and standards this analysis would make me reluctant to recommend to a friend or organisation. I would consider the software to be to high of a risk with a lack of clear mitigation for issues, maintainability and supportability.

										<p>Thanks for your post.
										<br>
										<br>
										I agree with your stance regarding that TrueCrypt wouldn’t be recommendable to a friend due to the 4 medium security risks you have identified from your analysis of the stem article. It is also interesting you have identified that the limitation heavily affecting TrueCrypt’s function is its inability to has credentials. And furthermore, I would be curious to explore the concept of a possible solution involving reconfiguration for compatibility with advances in GPU and CPU. Most importantly I agree with your position that TrueCrypt security is primarily compromised by the fact it is no longer maintained by developers making it redundant and deprecated.
										<br>
										<br>
										To add to your investigation, I would recommend a stronger negative recommendation to any friend that asks about TrueCrypt. This is because the state of TrueCrypt is determined as severe by the fact that there is no maintenance that now seeks to ensure the continued support of users. This is despite the recommendations made by Junestam & Guigo (2014). Additionally, it is alarming that outdated build tools cannot be sourced because less than trustworthy sources are the only ones to exist. Regardless I appreciate your final comment that you consider TrueCrypt a high-risk asset.

										<p>The cryptanalysis provided by Junestam & Guigo (2014) proves the assumption “Using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues” (TrueCrypt, 2014), true. This is because 11 vulnerabilities were identified during the Crypto Audit Project. 4 were of medium severity, 4 of low severity and 3 of an informational severity. Furthermore, several issues were identified in the bootloader decompressor and 5 issues with the readability (Junestam & Gugio (2014)). Thus, the position that TrueCrypt contains unfixed security issues is valid.
										<br>
										<br>
										I would not be prepared to recommend TrueCrypt to a friend as a secure storage environment. This is because the class of the security vulnerabilities suffered by the system are data exposure and data validation related. Thus, because these issues are directly related to the data contained within the TrueCrypt system, I would not recommend to a friend that they store their data in this system. They leave the system open to a variety of attack and exploit types. These include, brute force attacks and denial of service attacks (Junestam & Guigo, 2014). Furthermore, if the creators of the TrueCrypt system have lost confidence in the ability of the system they created to be secure against attacks similar to this or exactly like this, then it is important to trust their judgement because they have the greatest understanding of the system as the builders of it.

										<p>I do agree with your reasons and arguments for not recommending TrueCrypt. Your observations around the 11 identified vulnerabilities and the issues with bootloader are well defined and analysed. The assumptions by Junestam & Guigo (2014) in relation to unfixed security isses is a key point in the argument as well as further vulnerabilities.
										<br>
										<br>
										Additional points you raised also support the argument. By presenting and discussing issues around data exposure and the potential for the system to expose itself to brute force and DoS attacks you have considered many aspects of TrueCrypt and these points add additional weight and rationale.
										<br>
										<br>
										While not recommending TrueCrypt i would suggest that recommending alternatives to TrueCrypt that do not carry the same inherent flaws or lack of support and maintainability would be useful. Encryption tools should always be a viable option if they are secure and reliable.

										<p>The cryptanalysis report provided by Junestam and Guigo (2014) does support the assumption by the authors of TrueCrypt that “[u]sing TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues” (TrueCrypt, 2014). The findings of the report reveal four cryptography vulnerabilities in TrueCrypt, indicating that TrueCrypt lacks a fundamental sense of security. Furthermore, the report highlights these issues as potentially leading to unpredictable results, whereby it is stated that “CryptAcquireContext may silently fail in unusual scenarios” as well as “AES implementation [being] susceptible to cache-timing attacks” (Junestam and Guigo, 2014; p, 12), where both of these are marked as high in severity levels. Thus, the findings support the assumption by the authors of TrueCrypt that the application “may contain unfixed security issues”. On the other hand, as noted by cryptography specialist Matt Green, who commented on the report, “[t]he NCC audit found no evidence of deliberate backdoors, or any severe design flaws that will make the software insecure in most instances.” (Green, 2015). This is also important to bear in mind as the findings did not explicitly declare TrueCrypt as being insecure piece of software. However, the undoubtable thing is that TrueCrypt is no longer maintained and has not been since 2014. This means that if a security vulnerability is found, there will not be anybody to report it to, which means that it will not ever be fixed. Thus, while it may be deemed as a secure system now, there is an ever-growing risk that it may become insecure sometime in the future.
										<br>
										<br>
										In relation to the question of whether I would recommend TrueCrypt as a secure storage environment, I would again point to what I wrote above about the lack of maintainability of TrueCrypt by the developers, which would inevitably lead it to becoming more at risk of security vulnerabilities over time. Furthermore, as the nature of TrueCrypt is that it is inherently linked to the encryption of data from storage devices, I would be hesitant to ultimately be prepared recommend it to others.

									<h3 id="content">Peer #2 post - My response</h3>
										<p>I really enjoyed reading your post and your detailed analysis and your references were very enlightening. Too add further weight to the argument i would have detailed some of the specific technical aspects or security flaws within TrueCrypt.
										<br>
										<br>
										Furthermore, your reference to the NCC audit found no evidence of backdoors is a valid point. However, no back doors does not mean secure. As you discussed that it may be secure for now but may become insecure in the future. I would counter that it is already insecure as it is no longer maintained. Your closing argument on encryption of data however is key. By no longer supporting and maintaining TrueCrypt there is no way it can be updated with current algorithms and security, therefore data should be assumed to be not safe so TrueCrypt should not be recommended.
										<br>
										<br>
										I particularly like the ontology you have presented as it is understandable and presents clear definitions of the weaknesses in TrueCrypt and could be further supported by a visual representation.</p>
									<hr class="major" />
										<h2 id="content">Unit 10 - Collaborative Discussion 2 - Summary Post</h2>
										<p>Through response from and to my peers on the discussion of TrueCrypt the general opinion is that TrueCrypt would not be recommended to friends. After analysing Junestam & Guigo (2014) and their investigations into TrueCrypt and my peers research there are considerable risks. These include weaknesses such as data exposure of files and filesystems, hardware and OS resources and code complexity.
										<br>
										<br>
										What I have learnt from my peers is that many of us have taken views on the main 11 vulnerabilities of TrueCrypt. While these were not classified as high the common consensus is they are significant enough in regards to data exposure and security to present a high level of risk. Additionally, I would argue that the removal of support and maintenance is something I consider to be the highest risk. However, some of my peers have not discussed this in detail or perhaps do not consider it to be as significant.
										<br>
										<br>
										What I did find very useful is that some of my peers presented an ontology further supporting their arguments which is something I did not consider. I believe this adds further weight to a well rounded discussion to show deeper thought and critical thinking on the subject. Additionally, the proposal of newer, supported software that are replacements for TrueCrypt is another valid proposal. This raises additional questions of why one would consider TrueCrypt with no scope to update or modernise when there are viable alternatives available.
