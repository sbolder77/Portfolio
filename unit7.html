									<h2 id="content">API development</h2>
									<p>The exercise was to use a prepared python script to run, analyse and inspect a simplistic API built and executed in Python. Examining the execution and calls to pre-set API endpoints we were set with several questions related to the running and use of the API.
									</p>
									<h3 id="content">Question 1</h3>
									<p>What command did you use to compile and run the code?</p>
									<p>The code was run locally using the windows command line.</p>
									<h3>API Code</h3>

									<p>What happens when this command (http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/Ann) is run, and why?</p> <p>Whilst not executing a command the result can be achieved by calling the URL in a browser. The terminal that is already running records and logs the transaction and returns the appropriate HTTP response. In this example a 200 (success) message is recorded in the terminal as the user 'Ann' exists.</p>

									<p>What happens when this command (http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/Adam) is run, and why?</p>

									<h3 id="content">Question 4</h3>
									<p>What capability is achieved by the flask library?</p>
									<p>By importing the Flask library python has the capability of defining structured code for API functionality without having to code everything from scratch. Flask contains modules and functions inside the library that facilitate the creation of APIs in Python.</p>
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2 id="content">Simple Shell Command</h2>
									<p>The exercise was to write a simple CLI/Shell command to execute and run a number of commands. Consideration was to be made to answer several question about the code.</p>
									<h3>Shell Code</h3>
									<pre><code>'''Script to utilise basic CLI/Shell commands'''
import os

def shell_path():
    """Prints the contents of the current working directory"""
    print(os.listdir(os.getcwd()))
    
def shell_add():
    """Prints the addtion of 2 numeric values"""
    num1 = int(input("Please enter number 1: "))
    num2 = int(input("Please enter number 2: "))
    print(num1 + num2)

def shell_help():
    """Prints simple text about the python shell help"""
    print("""psh: shell implementation in Python.
          Supports all basic shell commands.""")

def main():
    """Executes functions based on input"""
    while True:
        inp = input("Please enter command in capitals - LIST/ADD/HELP/EXIT: ")
        if inp == "LIST":
            shell_path()
        elif inp == "ADD":
            shell_add()
        elif inp == "HELP":
            shell_help()
        elif inp == "EXIT":
            break

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()</code></pre>
									<h3 id="content">Question 1</h3>
									<p>What are the two main security vulnerabilities with your shell?</p>
									<p>The 2 main security vulnerabilities are lack of access control or authorisation and the script has access to the underlying os. This exposes attack surfaces where an attacker could gain access or inject commands to the os as well as not providing any sort of RBAC or authorisation control to the script.</p>
									<h3 id="content">Question 2</h3>
									<p>What is one recommendation you would make to increase the security of the shell?</p>
									<p>Seperate the code out further to ensure it is modular with seperate classes as well as introduce some form of authorisation and authentication to restrict access.</p>
									<h3>Pseudo Code</h3>
									<pre><code>Import security modules
Import cryptography modules

Import classes

Make variables private
Make class instances private

Define security function
Define encryption function
Define logging function

Define LIST function and help
Input for path
Encrypt file contents in path
Log on success/fail

Define Add function and help
Inputs for numeric values
Validate numeric values
Validate calculation
Log on success/fail

Define HELP function
Parameters for help
Log on success/fail

Define EXIT function
Safely and securely exit code
Log on success/fail

Define MAIN function
Check user security
Inputs for command to call</code></pre>

									<h2 id="content">What is an Ontology?</h2>
									<p>Ontologies, and more specifically in Computer Science can be defined as categories, properties and relations between concepts, data and entities in a domain. However, ontologies are not just specific to computer science and can be applied to many different industries and their subsequent domains.</p>
									<p>(Gruber 1993) discusses how an Ontology is an explicit specification of a concept and a concept is an abstract view of the domain. While the observations are valid I disagree that an ontology is a specification of an abstracted view. Rather that ontologies today are often the abstarcted view of the domain and do not require a definition of their own. It is perhaps as domains and industries have expanded and advanced that ontologies are becoming more of a standard or reference for domains so therefore do not require 2 levels of definition. As with many other  </p>
