										<h2 id="content">Unit 1 - Introduction to Secure Software Development</h2>
										<p>This unit was an introduction to the concepts we will use through the module. By exploring UML, development standards, risk awareness in organisations as well as Waterfal and Agile approaches to software development the unit will form a foundation for security responsible attitude to secure software development.</p>
										<h2>Formative Activities</h2>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>ePortfolio</h3>
												<p>The activity was to setup a portfolio or add to an existing one to support learning and additional activites through the module. We were also requested to provide a link to our ePortfolios for review by our peers and lecturer.</p>

												<h3>Introductory Seminar</h3>
												<p>The first seminar was an introduction to the module and an opportunity for us to meet our Tutor and our peers. We were presented with an over view and introduction to the individual work and the team project to be delivered through the module. Teams were agreed on with a deliverable of a signed contract related to the summative assignements delivered through the module.</p>

										<h2 id="content">Unit 1-3 - Collaborative discussion</h2>
										<p>The collaborative discussion involved us submitting a forum post discussing one of the top 10 OWASP weaknesses and supported by a UML flow diagram to represent how a piece of software would become 'broken'. Through the 3 weeks we would be expected to submit our initial post and then follow up by leaving reviews of our peer submissions.</p>
										<h3>Initial Post</h3>
										<p>The OWASP coding weakness I have focussed on in my discussion is A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures. I have represented the flow of a sample registration using an activity diagram as a high-level process flow.
										<br>
										The activity diagram highlights the steps that would be executed in a laboratory for logging and testing a sample as well as sending results. By only logging the select events of authentication and logging in a sample it fails to identify all the logging or monitoring that would be required through the process which would be recognised as a weakness and broken. With the sensitivity and criticality of the process and data, it should be assumed that security logging and monitoring would take place across all steps. By being able to complete the sample after authentication the software bypasses authorisation and emailing sample data is also not logged so the software misses crucial auditing and system logs/monitoring.
										<br>
										In addition to an activity diagram use case diagrams would be an appropriate choice to successfully represent the actors required for consuming and actioning logging and monitoring events that are captured through the software.
										<br>
										Furthermore, a sequence diagram would support the messages and their states through the software transaction process. The activity diagram could maintain the process flow and the supporting diagrams would surface the objects and states to log and monitor.
