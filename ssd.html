										<h2 id="content">Formative Activities - Coding, Seminars & Team Activities</h2>
										<p>The module covered a range of formative assignments icluding coding concepts and seminar activities to support the objectives and delivery of a team development assignment. The content covered a wide range of concepts all of which were developed through the Codio IDE or independently in Visual Studio. Most of the evaluation and prototyping was carried out in Visual Studio to utilise a more familiar development environment.</p>
