									</header>
									<h2 id="content">Learning Outcomes</h2>
										<p>- Acquire a critical understanding of the concept of abstraction in programming.
										<br>
										- Develop an understanding of the basic principles of secure development methodologies.
										<br>
										- Explore how to undertake analysis, program design, software construction and testing required for software development.
										<br>
										- Demonstrate an understanding of the basic principles of architecture, as well as traditional and contemporary Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models, such as TOGAF and Agile.

										<h2 id="content">Formative Activities</h2>
										<p>The module covered a range of formative assignments including coding concepts and seminar activities to support the objectives and delivery of a team development assignment. The content covered a wide range of concepts all of which were developed through the Codio IDE or independently in Visual Studio. Most of the evaluation and prototyping was carried out in Visual Studio to utilise a more familiar development environment.</p>
										<div class="row">

										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Unit 1-3 - UML Flowchart</h3>
												<p>We were asked to select one of the coding weaknesses which have been identified by OWASP and create a flowchart for a piece of software and the steps which may lead to the weakness occurring. We discussed which UML models might be used and why are they the most appropriate choice(s)?</p>
