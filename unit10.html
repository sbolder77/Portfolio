									<h2 id="content">Faceted Data</h2>
										<p>In regard to Schmitz et al (2016) I think the approach is good but does have risks. The approach does have some benefits as described in the pros below. By been able to run multiple executions you can see better performance but at the financial risk of more computing resource. And while a library would be more usable and require less time on development there is a dependency to ensure that any such library is also maintained and updated. However, there are many additional factors to consider like testing and validation. With potentially complex mathematics and algortithims encapsulated in a library it would be difficult to make an assessment on it's use in secure software development.</p>
										<h3 id="content">Pros</h3>
										<div class="box">
										<p>- Information flow analysis enforces security in a systemic fashion
<br>										
- Utilising non-interference ensures public inputs do not rely on private inputs
<br>
- Multiple executions within a single process with values containing public and private views of data
<br>
- Language runtime requires no modification and can be incorporated into existing language as a library</p>
										</div>
										<h3 id="content">Cons</h3>
										<div class="box">
										<p>- Dependency on data and filesystems having adeqaute security in place
<br>
- Potentially difficult to analyze bugs
<br>
- Requires advanced mathematical knowledge
<br>
- Difficult to understand
<br>
- Has a high chance of becoming complex and risks introducing errors
<br>
- Higher performance on infrastructure</p>
