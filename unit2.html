									<h2 id="content">Scrum Security review</h2>
									<p>The task was to create a table including the software development stages of the Scrum Agile lifecycle. We were asked to include descriptions about the processes we would recommend are applied at each stage to ensure secure software is delivered. Scrum and Agile are interpretaive and organisations will define their own framework around agile or may combine aspects of waterfall and agile so there are no real single defeinitions of the phases in SDLC. The table illustrates the common phases in the Scrum Agile SDLC. The recommendations are common practice at these stages to ensure development goals are met and not just security measures as it is a framework. However, by following the processes at each of these steps would ensure visibility and traceability against the original requirements adn what is designed and delivered through a software development project.</p>

									<h2 id="content">Blog</h2>
									<p>We were asked to select five terms from ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 Terms and Definitions and write a 300-word blog post on how people can be managed to overcome cyber security attacks from the inside.</p>
									<h3 id="content">People and the risks that they pose to cyber security and IT systems</h3>
									<p>I have selected the following 5 terms from ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 Terms and Definitions.</p>
									<h3 id="content">3.1 Access Control - means to ensure that access to assets is authorized and restricted based on business and security requirements</h3>
									<p>Managing access to both physical and digital assets is paramount to ensuring cyber attacks are prevented. By implementing key card access systems for physical assets and RBAC controls for digital assets organisations can ensure only the right people have access to the right things.</p>
									<h3 id="content">3.5 Authentication - provision of assurance that a claimed characteristic of an entity is correct</h3>
									<p>By defining which people are allowed or not allowed to export, edit or view any stored information in a system via authentication ensures prevention of cyber security breaches. By ensuring that unauthenticated persons canoot access system information and also recording this unathenticated access ensures organisations as well as their internal people are protected. </p>
									<h3 id="content">3.46 Monitoring - determining the status of a system, a process</h3>
									<p>By monitoring peoples activities in regards to information systems records can be kept to identify threats from internal persons icluding but not limited to inproper use or unauthorised access attempts. This supports further business process through training and regular reviews of system access.</p>
									<h3 id="content">3.9 Competence - ability to apply knowledge and skills to achieve intended results</h3>
									<p>Competence of developers, architects and system users is integral to cyber security best practise in an organisation. Ensuring these people are competent and able in their role and their understanding of security and the secure nature of sytems they design, develop or use is crucial. Lack of competence exposes the organisation to outside threats if the inside people are not competent.</p>
									<h3 id="content">3.10 Confidentiality - property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes</h3>
									<p>By ensuring confidentiality processes around data and systems organisations can ensure inside people are aware of what can be shared both internally and externally. Combined with authentication and access controls confidentiality is implied but not enforced. If people do not or organisations do not conform or abide to confidentiality practices an organisation or system can be exposed to potential attacks. If internally there is no confidentiality then the external risk is higher if confidential information is shared.</p>
