									<!-- Content -->
										<p>As a team we worked collaboratively on the design document. We shared it through Google Docs and regulalry reviewd content and progress. In addition to the regular review process internally in the team we also presented to our lecturer to get feedback and comments on structure and content. We all worked independently on specific areas as well as a team on shared or general content to agree on our approach and design. UML diagrams were shared between the team based on strengths and knowledge which proved to be a valuable experience in finalising the document and was a true reflection of the work the team completed.</p>
